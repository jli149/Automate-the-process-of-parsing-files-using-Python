# Automate-the-process-of-parsing-files-using-Python
This project involves using Python to work with a text file “allow_list.txt” that contains IP addresses that are allowed to access specific content at an organization. Additionally, the project requires writing an algorithm to automate the process of parsing files and to update the text file by removing IP addresses that shouldn’t have access.
